# **C-Cpp-Assignments: C++ Programming Fundamentals (BSCS Practice)**  
This repository contains my first-semester BSCS practice codes and assignments written in C++.  
All programs demonstrate foundational learning in **C++ programming, logic building, and core data structures**.

---

## 📘 **What I Learned**
This repository covers hands-on learning in:

- Basic Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Conditional Logic (`if/else`, nested conditions)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- **1D Arrays & core array algorithms**
- **2D Arrays (matrix operations and simulations)**
- Functions & modular code structure
- String handling & search logic
- Arithmetic & logical problem solving
- Input validation and error handling

> ✅ Note: This repository contains exercises specifically designed to practice **1D and 2D arrays**, including reversing arrays, finding unique elements, summing rows/columns, and simulating grid-based problems.

## 📚 **Additional Practice Programs**

### **CubePileHeight.cpp**
Checks whether a number can be expressed as a sum of consecutive cubes. Demonstrates iterative accumulation & arithmetic reasoning.

### **ElementalDamageCalc.cpp**
Calculates attack damage using type-matching rules. Demonstrates branching logic and numeric operations.

### **CountPrimesInRange.cpp**
Uses nested loops to count prime numbers in a range.

### **NumberClassification.cpp**
Classifies a number as **Evil**, **Odious**, or **Pernicious** by analyzing its binary representation.

## 🌟 **Featured Project: Cyclic Summation Comparison**

| File | Approach | Summary |
|------|----------|---------|
| `mode_cycle.cpp` | **Modulus Method** | Uses `counter % 3` to assign digits. Concise and scalable. |
| `newAttempt.cpp` | **Counter Method** | Uses independent counters for clarity and easy tracing. |

This project demonstrates comparison-based problem solving and optimized logic design.

## 🎮 N x N Tic-Tac-Toe Game (C++)

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It allows players to define the size of the grid (N x N), making it a generalized version of the standard 3x3 game.

### ✨ Features

* **Customizable Grid Size:** Supports N x N grid sizes, up to 30x30.
* **Two Players:** Uses 'X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters valid, un-taken cell numbers within the specified board range.
* **Win Conditions:** Checks for wins across rows, columns, and both diagonals.

### ⚙️ How to Run Locally

To compile and run this program, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++ or MinGW).

1.  **Compile the file:**
    ```bash
    g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    ./tictactoe
    ```
3.  **Follow Prompts:** Enter the desired grid size (e.g., 5) and then enter the cell number for each turn.
