#C-Cpp-Assignments: C++ Programming Fundamentals (BSCS Practice)

This repository contains my practice codes and assignments from my first-semester BSCS coursework in C++. All exercises demonstrate proficiency in fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and logic.

📚 Additional Practice Programs

This section contains several small C++ programs demonstrating number algorithms, type-based calculations, prime number counting, and binary number analysis. These exercises help strengthen fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and arithmetic operations.

**CubePileHeight.cpp**
Checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of consecutive cubes and returns the height of the cube pile. Demonstrates iterative accumulation and basic arithmetic operations.

**ElementalDamageCalc.cpp**
Calculates attack damage based on type, opponent type, power, and defense. Demonstrates conditional logic and arithmetic operations in C++.

**CountPrimesInRange.cpp**
Counts all prime numbers from 1 up to a given number. Demonstrates nested loops, conditional statements, and basic number theory logic.

**NumberClassification.cpp**
Determines whether a number is Evil, Odious, or Pernicious based on its binary representation and the sum of 1s. Demonstrates loops, modulo operations, and simple prime checking.

🌟 Featured Project: Cyclic Summation Comparison

This section details a dedicated project comparing two methods for solving a complex logic problem, demonstrating high-level logical thinking and code design.

🚀 Project Overview

This project contains two C++ implementations designed to solve a cyclical data grouping problem: sorting user-inputted digits into three separate sums (Sum 1, Sum 2, and Sum 3) based on their input order. This comparison was created to evaluate the trade-offs between two methods for achieving scalable cyclical logic.

🧐 **Comparison Files**
File Name	Approach	Description & Trade-Off
mode_cycle.cpp	The Modulus Method	Uses the remainder of the loop index (counter % 3) to assign the digit. Pro: Highly concise and scalable.
newAttempt.cpp	The Counter Method	Uses three independent counter variables to track positions. Pro: Highly explicit and easy to trace.

📚 Foundational Practice & Assignments
This repository also contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed to perform basic calculations, check conditions, and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like functions, loops, and user input validation. These are starting points for learning C++ programming.

**Core Concepts Demonstrated**:

*Basic Input/Output* (cout and cin)

*Fundamental Arithmetic Operations*

*Data Type Handling (int, float, long long)*

*Functions, Loops, and User Input Validation*

**📚Files Included**:
*Topic	File Name(s):	Description*
Game Logic	rockPaperSissors.cpp	A two-player game implementing conditional logic to determine the winner based on choices.
Calculators	"calculator.cpp"	Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with input validation for numbers and division-by-zero checking.
Conditional Logic	"discount_clac.cpp", "Is_Even_Or_Odd_calc.cpp", "pass_fail_checker.cpp", "voting_eligibility.cpp"	Checks various conditions (discounts, parity, passing scores, age limits).
Unit/Area	"inchesToFeet_calc.cpp", "stickers_calc.cpp"	Converts measurements or calculates surface area ("6 * length^2").
Utility/Formulas	"requiredFuel_calc.cpp", "admission-aggregate-score.cpp", "tournament-points-calc.cpp"	Calculates fuel, scores, and other practical formulas.
Looping Example	"unterminated_string.cpp"	Demonstrates an infinite loop to repeatedly print a user's name.
Search Letter from a Given String/Array	"letter_search.cpp"	This code demonstrates basic string iteration and character search in C++. The isFind function checks if a given character exists in a string by iterating through the string, comparing each character with the target.
**Key Concepts Covered**:
String Manipulation: Iterating through a string using the length() function and indexing.
Boolean Functions: Returning a boolean result (1 or 0) based on the search result.
Control Structures: Using a for loop to iterate over a string. |
