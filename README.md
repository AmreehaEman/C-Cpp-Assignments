# C-Cpp-Assignments: C++ Programming Fundamentals (BSCS Practice)

**This repository contains my practice codes and assignments from my first-semester BSCS coursework in C++. All exercises demonstrate proficiency in fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and logic**.

📚 Additional Practice Programs
<br>
This section contains several small C++ programs demonstrating number algorithms, type-based calculations, prime number counting, and binary number analysis. These exercises help strengthen fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and arithmetic operations.

**CubePileHeight.cpp**:
<br>
Checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of consecutive cubes and returns the height of the cube pile. Demonstrates iterative accumulation and basic arithmetic operations.

**ElementalDamageCalc.cpp**:
<br>
Calculates attack damage based on type, opponent type, power, and defense. Demonstrates conditional logic and arithmetic operations in C++.

**CountPrimesInRange.cpp**:
<br>
Counts all prime numbers from 1 up to a given number. Demonstrates nested loops, conditional statements, and basic number theory logic.

**NumberClassification.cpp**:
<br>
Determines whether a number is Evil, Odious, or Pernicious based on its binary representation and the sum of 1s. Demonstrates loops, modulo operations, and simple prime checking.

🌟 Featured Project: Cyclic Summation Comparison

This section details a dedicated project comparing two methods for solving a complex logic problem, demonstrating high-level logical thinking and code design.

🧐 **Comparison Files**:<br>
File Name	Approach	Description & Trade-Off
mode_cycle.cpp	The Modulus Method	Uses the remainder of the loop index (counter % 3) to assign the digit. Pro: Highly concise and scalable.
newAttempt.cpp	The Counter Method	Uses three independent counter variables to track positions. Pro: Highly explicit and easy to trace.

**📚 Foundational Practice & Assignments**<br>
This repository also contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed to perform basic calculations, check conditions, and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like functions, loops, and user input validation. These are starting points for learning C++ programming.

**Core Concepts Demonstrated**:

*Basic Input/Output* (cout and cin)
*Fundamental Arithmetic Operations*
*Data Type Handling (int, float, long long)*
*Functions, Loops, and User Input Validation*

**Key Concepts Covered in string search**:
String Manipulation: Iterating through a string using the length() function and indexing.
Boolean Functions: Returning a boolean result (1 or 0) based on the search result.
Control Structures: Using a for loop to iterate over a string. |

### Key Concepts Covered in Array Section
This group of files demonstrates specific mastery in the following areas:
* **Iteration & Control:** Effective use of nested loops, boolean flags (`temp`), and the `break` statement for efficient data checking.
* **Functions:** Correctly passing arrays and size as arguments to custom functions (e.g., `findLargestNumber`, `calculateTotalResistance`).
* **Array Manipulation:** Algorithms for reversing array order and logically inserting array data during print output.
* **Monetary Accuracy:** Handling `float` and `double` data types correctly for accurate real-world monetary calculations.
