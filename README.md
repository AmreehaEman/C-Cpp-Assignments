# C-Cpp-Assignments
The practice codes in C++ language.
C++ Programming Fundamentals (BSCS Practice)
This repository contains my practice codes and assignments from my first-semester BSCS coursework in C++.

These exercises demonstrate proficiency in:

# Basic Input/Output (cout and cin)
Fundamental Arithmetic Operations
Data Type Handling (int, float, long long)
Projects Included:
Topic:
Unit Converters:	hours-to-seconds-calc.cpp, pounds-to-kilograms.cpp, etc.
Physics/Math Calculators:	charge-time-current-calc.cpp, rectangle-area-calc.cpp
Practical Formulas:	admission-aggregate-score.cpp, tournament-points-calc.cpp


# This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed to perform basic calculations, check conditions, and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like functions, loops, and user input validation. These are  starting points for learning C++ programming.
Files are:
calculator.cpp : Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with input validation for numbers and division-by-zero checking.
discount_clac.cpp : Calculates the payable amount after applying a 10% discount on Sunday and a 5% discount on other days.
inchesToFeet_calc.cpp  : Converts a measurement from inches to feet.
requiredFuel_calc.cpp  : Calculates the fuel needed based on a given distance (assuming 10 units of fuel per unit of distance).
Is_Even_Or_Odd_calc.cpp :  Determines if an integer is even or odd.
pass_fail_checker.cpp  :  Checks if a student is Pass or Fail based on a threshold (score > 50 is Pass).
voting_eligibility.cpp  : Determines if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).
stickers_calc.cpp  : Calculates the number of stickers required to cover a cube's surface area, assuming a sticker covers a unit area (Formula: 6*lenght^2).
unterminated_string.cpp  : This file demonstrates an infinite loop to repeatedly print a user's name.Prints the user's input indefinitely using a while(true) loop.
